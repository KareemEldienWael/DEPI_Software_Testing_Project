# DEPI Software Testing Project
This project is an end-to-end web automation testing framework built using Selenium.  
Our target website for automation is [Coursera], where we automate and validate critical workflows such as search, filters, user authentication, and transactions.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members
* Kareem Eldien Wael Abdualla
* Merola Gerges Gadallah
* Lujain Sherif Hussein
* Ahmed Saqr

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
* Learn and apply Selenium WebDriver for automation testing.
* Design and implement test scenarios that cover key user journeys.
* Build a maintainable test framework with reusable components.
* Demonstrate automation testing skills for portfolio and learning purposes.

## ðŸ“‹ Features to Automate
âœ… Search functionality  
âœ… Course filters  
âœ… User authentication (login/signup)  
âœ… Basic transaction flow (enroll, checkout simulation)  
âœ… API testing with Postman (course listings, search API, etc.)  

## ðŸ“… Time Plan (One Month)
**Week 1**  
- Environment setup (Selenium, Postman, GitHub repo structure).  
- Assign tasks and finalize feature list.  
- Manual testing of Coursera workflows (document test cases).  

**Week 2**  
- Automate search and filter test cases with Selenium.  
- Begin Postman API tests for course search endpoints.  
- Daily syncs to review progress.  

**Week 3**  
- Automate authentication flows (login, signup).  
- Automate basic transaction (enroll/checkout simulation).  
- Improve framework with reusable components (page objects).  

**Week 4**  
- Run full regression suite (manual + automated).  
- Documentation of test results and issues found.  
- Finalize project report and presentation.
