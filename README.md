# DEPI Software Testing Project

## 📌 Project Idea
This project is an end-to-end web automation testing framework built using Selenium and Postman.  
Our target website for automation is [Coursera], where we automate and validate critical workflows such as search, filters, user authentication, and transactions.

## 👥 Team Members (pentaRae)
* Kareem Eldien Wael Abdualla  
* Merola Gerges Gadallah  
* Lujain Sherif Hussein  
* Ahmed Saqr  

## 🗂 Work Plan
1. **Research & Analysis**  
   - Explore Coursera workflows (search, filters, authentication, transactions).  
   - Define manual test cases and document user journeys.  

2. **Framework Setup**  
   - Configure Selenium WebDriver and Postman environments.  
   - Establish project structure and version control.  

3. **Core Automation**  
   - Automate search and filter workflows.  
   - Automate authentication (login/signup).  
   - Simulate basic transaction flow (enroll/checkout).  

4. **Complementary Testing**  
   - Postman API testing for course search and listings.  
   - Regression testing (manual + automated).  
   - Reporting and documentation.  

5. **Review & Finalization**  
   - Debug and optimize framework.  
   - Validate test coverage and execution results.  

6. **Final Presentation**  
   - Present test results, framework design, and learning outcomes.  

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities
* **Kareem Eldien Wael Abdualla** – Team Lead & Automation Engineer (repo management, framework setup, transaction automation).  
* **Merola Gerges Gadallah** – API & Postman Specialist (API test cases, integration with reports).
